In order to run ARISCA Lofi, developers will need to be able to locally host the site since it is not hosted anywhere permanently. If using VSCode, the Live Server extension version 5.7.9 worked at time of "launch". All code is written in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript so no compiler is necessary as web browsers will interpret.
